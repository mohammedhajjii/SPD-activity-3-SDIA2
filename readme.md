# Practical Activity NÂ°3 - Event Driven Architecture with KAFKA

## Purpose

In this practical activity we learn how to implement an `Event Driven Architecture` with Kafka broker,
in this activity we try to implement:
- `simple event producer` with `StreamBridge` class.
- `Consume` events or messages with functional approach `Consumer<T>`
- `Generate` records periodically using `Supplier<T>` bean.
- `Process` records using `Function<T, R>` object.
- `Real time processing` using also `Function<T, R>`


### Run Kafka in local
